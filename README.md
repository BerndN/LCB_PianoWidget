# LCB_PianoWidget
A LiveCode Builder Graphical Piano Keyboard Widget 

Video Demo Here:

This is a work in progress at the moment.

Planned features include:

• Auto-hilighting chords via a chord-formula property.

• Setting highlights for individual keys on the piano via LCS script.

Once the above features are added I will consider this at Version 1.0

Version 2.0 will likely have improved graphics and be rebuilt as a smaller "Composed Widget", provided a particular bug in LCB gets fixed.
